My Extentions:


1) Favourites: 
	favourite and unfavourite puns(messages)! you can do so in the attack(outgoing) tab,
	the defence(incoming) tab, and by clicking puns in the war log(chat) activity

	favourite puns appear in the favourites tab


2) Speed Optimisation:
	connects w Parse only when neccessary 
		stores friends/all_users lists locally so it doesn't need to keep querying

	checks if list has been changed before resetting listview
		if unchanged it doesn't


3) Log In & Sign Up:
	checks if user exists, if not redirects to signup page

	password Edit Texts clear when there's an error for extra safety

	double confirm your password when creating account


4) Logical UI:
	pages refresh after you click something
		eg aft favouriting a pun, the pun page reloads

	jumps
		to rivals(friends) tab after adding friend
		to rivals(friends) tab if you click the attack button on the action bar
		to favourites tab after favouriting a pun

	situational buttons and imageviews
		buttons and images change based on item
			(eg favourites are a yellow star, normal are buttons for you to favourite)
			(eg rivals in online tab link to war log, strangers a button to add as friend)

	action bar icons yay. to attack(go rivals pg) and log out

	buttons rather than clicking the entire listitem
		(some intense onclicklisteners if you see my code ><)


5) Friends:
	friend and unfriend random strangers! yay! you can only attack friends by clicking in the
	rivals tab, so no attacking strangers!


6) Gr9 Puns (Theme):
	themed everything from swords to shields, attacks to defences, rivals to... rivals
